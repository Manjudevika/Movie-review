<p  style="font-style: italic; font-size:medium;text-align:center; "><b>Love </b>is blind, decreed a person who possibly went on to write film scripts. In Sita Ramam, love plays dumb too.

    Hanu Raghavapudi’s previously released Telugu-language period drama has re-emerged in cinemas in a Hindi dubbed version. Sita Ramam is set between the 1960s and the 1980s, a time of snail mail, steam engines and suspension of disbelief.
A handsomely produced and self-consciously epic romance in which lovers strive to be together against the backdrop of momentous events, Sita Ramam is Mani Ratnam and Yash Chopra by way of the Hollywood classic Roman Holiday, with a nod to current Hindu-Muslim tensions.

    Afreen (Rashmika Mandanna) is a student president of Pakistan at a university in London. She takes up the job of delivering a letter to Sita Mahalakshmi (Mrunal Thakur) at the insistence of her grandfather’s will. Though she doesn’t like the job, she agrees to do it to get her share of her grandfather’s property. The letter is written by Lieutenant Ram (Dulquer Salmaan) to Sita. Who is this Ram? Who is Sita Mahalakshmi? What is the connection between Ram and Afreen’s grandfather? Watch the film to know the answers.
Starring Dulquer Salmaan, Mrunal Thakur and Rashmika Mandanna in lead roles, Sita Ramam is a visually beautiful tale of love and loss. It has all the makings of being labelled a classic love story, but falls short in certain aspects. The film flits between two time period — the 1960s and the 1980s. It starts with a patriotic young Pakistani woman, Afreen, burning a car of a respected Indian figure in London in 1980s. She has a massive hatred for anything or anyone Indian. <br>She is symbolises the animosity and hatred that brewed between India and Pakistan after the partition. Her hatred of Indians does not stem from personal experience though. She is the granddaughter of Brigadier Taariq, who is clearly against her blind hatred of the neighbouring country.

In contrast to this is Lieutenant Ram. He looks beyond religion and borders, while keeping his patriotism intact. This young man, who went beyond what his role required of him in the army is celebrated for stopping a massacre on a Hindu village in Kashmir. He clears up the misunderstanding that crops up among Kashmiri Muslims after young men are killed by the army. They have credible information about Mujahideen teens who have crossed borders to do as their leader directed. Ram stands between a group of Muslims and Hindus, risks his life to ensure that terror doesn’t rain upon Kashmir.

<p style="justify-content:left; text-align: left; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-family: cursive;" ><img align="right" src="./Pictures/s3.png" alt="" height="17%" width="17%" style="margin: 10px; border: 3px solid rgb(97, 93, 93);">The contrasts are visible throughout the film, hatred and love. There is also the red and blue of unity, and there is Sitamahalakshmi and Ram. Before his death, Afreen’s grandfather gives her one last task. If she were to complete it, she will inherit his wealth. In need of some urgent money, Afreen accepts the mission and in this journey she unlearns the hatred that had been buried deep within her for her neighboring.

 She learns about Ram’s life, his love for his country and the gorgeous Sitamahalakshmi. Her mission is to hand over his last letter to his lover.
As the film unfolds, we learn important bits and pieces of information about Ram and Sita. 
It comes in fragments, as it is a story that is narrated to Afreen by different people who had known Ram and Sita in the past. She learns about a person who proves every belief of hers about Indian wrong. <br>She learns about a woman who gave it all for her love. The idea is interesting. To introduce hate first, and then reveal things that which would destroy hate from within — love, hope, dreams and more. So in that vein, Ram’s life symbolises the hopes and dreams of many who want a world absent of hatred.
Now, the problem arises for me personally when this very symbol of hope that the film took hours to built is destroyed within minutes. From the first letters that arrived from Sita (voiced to perfection by Chinmayi), to the last letter that Ram had penned for her, just this back and forth induces old world nostalgia. It also underlines how desperate humans were for contact in absence of all the communication devices that the world has today. The closure that Ram seeks with his last letter, the one that Sita seeks every year when she visits Kashmir in his absence, is a treasure trove that could have been explored further. Maybe then, a sad ending would be befitting of this film that aims to be a classic love story.

        We have been hearing what a terrific performer Dulquer Salmaan . The actor once again proves his worth with Sita Ramam. He breathes life into Lieutenant Ram’s character. He looks good and his screen presence is blazing. Be it the emotional scenes or the romantic ones, he delivers them splendidly.
        
        The surprise package here is Mrunal Thakur. She makes a staggering Telugu debut. She looked gorgeous in sarees and performed with ease. She surely will have a bright future ahead.
        
        The romantic track has been handled in a very classy manner. The scenes involving the lead pair were showcased majestically and the chemistry is cracking. The music is very rich. Some scenes will tug your heartstrings.
        
        Though there are a lot of characters on screen, each has its significance which is not an easy task to handle. Sumanth and Rashmika’s roles are beautifully woven into this story. They got major roles and did a splendid job. The character arc of Sumanth has been written with perfection. Though this is a love story, certain major twists are well placed in the film that are whistle worthy.
        
        Few dialogues spark and make us think. They are short and register well. The second half of the movie is terrific, to say the least. The way the war angle has been brought into a love story deserves special applause. The writing team did an exquisite job.</P>
<P style="justify-items:center; text-align: left; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-family: cursive;" >

    The first half of the film is slow-paced. Director took more time to get into the actual plot. Even though the story is set well, it takes more of the screen time. The editing team could have done an, even more, better job by reducing the length to prop up the film’s tempo.
    
    The comedy in the film looks a bit odd. Though it evokes laughs it feels like it is not necessary to this plot. There are a few logical errors. To name one, a character looks the same even after 20 years without much change.
    
    The theme of the movie may not appeal to the masses. The songs at places come as speed breakers disturbing the flow of the film. The film turns out a bit slow at times making it feel lengthy.

    <P style="justify-items:center; text-align: left; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-family: cursive;" >
        <img align="right" src="./Pictures/s5.png" alt="" height="10%" width="12%" style="margin: 10px; border: 3px solid rgb(97, 93, 93);">The production values are top-notch. The makers have spent very well on the film which is pretty evident on the screen. Even for smaller roles noted artists have been brought on board which added much value to the film. Production house should be appreciated for this. The visuals are eye-catching. Cinematographer PS Vinod and Shreyas were phenomenal in depicting the numerous locations present in the film. The majestic Kashmir is well captured.

        The music by Vishal Chandrasekhar is very pleasant and sets the mood for this beautiful love story. The background score is just perfect. The editing team did an okayish job. The length of the film is its main stumbling block. The first half could have been crisp.
        
        Coming to director Hanu Raghavapudi, he clearly overcame his second-half syndrome. As promised in the promotions, he delivered big time with the latter part. The way he narrated this love story with enchanting visuals, and prodigious characterizations, is stupendous. Though the first half isn’t great he makes it up with his storytelling in the later hour. He delivered one of the best love stories in a long time.</P>
        <P style="justify-items:center; text-align: left; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-family: cursive;" >Verdict:

            On the whole Sita Ramam is a beautiful love story. The film has a decent first half and great second half. The scintillating performances by all the lead cast, the pleasing narrative, and the poetic writing will make you poignant and heartwarming. As the film is centered around a simple love story and war, it may not be overwhelming to the masses. Almost all the departments did a superlative job. Director Hanu gave us a beautiful and aesthetic love story that should surely be enjoyed on big screens. You can surely watch this film without a doubt. It is worth all your money.</P>
