        The Rudravaram villagers accuse Venkata Chalapathy (Kamal Kamaraju) of the deaths in the village and burn his family alive. The wife gives a curse to the village before she dies. Twelve years after that the deaths begin again. Surya (Sai Dharam Tej) comes to the village and falls in love with Nandini (Samyuktha Menon). He gets struck in the village due to Nandini and starts digging into serial deaths. Will he find the truth? Who is doing all this? Virupaksha is all about the Surya solving the mystery.
        Set in the backdrop of the 1990s, the story takes place in a village named Rudravanam. Surya (Sai Dharam Tej), along with his mother, visit their village after a long time. He instantly falls in love with Nandini (Samyukta Menon), a village belle and daughter of Rudravanam’s sarpanch. Suddenly a series of mysterious events happen in the village, and people keep dying one after the other. What’s actually happening in Rudravanam? What’s the reason behind the continuous deaths? How did Surya unravel the mystery? The movie has the answers.
        It’s the 1990s. But some people are still reliant on ancient text to know right from wrong, leading to superstition with fatal consequences. Surya (Sai Dharam Tej) has returned to his mother’s village Rudravanam which is gearing up for a Modamamba Thalli jatara. <br>
        The village sarpanch Harischandra Prasad (Rajeev Kanakala) and the rest of the village are busy with the preparations for it. When Surya meets the sarpanch’s daughter Nandini (Samyuktha), he falls for her hard. Even as these two and another couple in the village seem embroiled in romance, the past seems to come knocking. A chain of events leads to multiple deaths and Surya strives to find the root cause of it all.
Virupaksha starts off well. We’re shown how in the 1970s certain heinous decisions are made from a place of fear and superstition. But everything seems safe and sound in the 1990s.

    Surya and his mother spend quality time with his cousin (Syamala) and other villagers. The film’s first half is quite racy except for when it takes a breather from death to focus on the romance. The dialogues make it sound more emotional than it is. It makes you impatient but it has a pay off.
    When a story discusses paranormal activities, it is easy to brush it aside as superstition. The task of the storyteller, then, is to build the world of the story such that the viewer is drawn into it and remains invested in the mysterious happenings and begins to empathise with some of the characters.
    The second half of the film takes a turn. And while the film shines when it focuses on the story at hand, some of the portions might seem draggy. But if you’re paying close attention, you’ll notice that the film was peppering clues all along for you to join the dots. <br>
    Could the climax have been better? Sure. But without shoving explanations down your throat, everything just suddenly seems to make sense.
    Virupaksha is a well-crafted film – the kind that makes you look at the characters beyond the actors because the film has a suffocating atmosphere that’ll draw you in. The kind that makes you flinch but not want to look away at the same time. And it’s the crew that’s to be thanked for that. The sound design is stellar, so is the background score by Ajaneesh Loknath, it truly sets the mood for most of the scenes. The cinematography by Shamdat is also quite good, so is Kartik’s direction. The best part is that, while the film has jump scares, it doesn't rely on just that to keep you engaged.
    We get plenty of night sequences (some of which doff the hat to Manoj Night Shyamalan), unexplained deaths, a desolated mansion and rituals of different kinds. </p>

        <img align="left" src="./Pictures/V4.png" alt="" height="20%" width="20%" style="margin: 10px; border: 3px solid whitesmoke;">
        Along with the cinematography, Ajaneesh Loknath’s background score, Navin Nooli’s editing and remarkable sound design ensure that the interest is sustained and the narrative delivers chills from time to time. 
        There are no screeching ghosts, no gory jumpscares but enough situations to invoke fear. A story such as this is also bound to be flashback heavy to unravel a few plot points. These reveals are effective and also help to sidestep certain cliched tropes. To explain further would mean revealing spoilers.  And thankfully, the film has just two situational songs and half an action sequence that soon outlives its welcome.
    Sai Dharam Tej fits the bill as an outsider investigating a mystery. He is happy being a bystander until he finds himself in a spot. Samyuktha has a good screen presence and makes it count in the later portions that demand something more from her.
    While the romantic track between the hero and heroine is tedious, it is linked to crucial final scenes. Nonetheless, the director should have come up with a better romantic track. There are also numerous loose ends. Furthermore, those who have seen similar thrillers will notice that many of these sequences are overtly familiar.

    On the whole, "Virupaksha" is a mystic thriller that stays true to its genre, and the narration captures our attention for the most part. Despite some flaws, such as dragged-out scenes at the end and a mediocre romantic score, the film is worth a watch. It is heavily reliant on technical output, which has greatly aided the film.
    The film perfectly creates the ambience at the very beginning and keeps on adding layers as the story progresses. After a shocking interval, the second half slightly drops in pace as the various pieces of the jigsaw are put together, to finally pick pace in the pre climax sequence. The climax is impressive, though it clearly wants to shock and awe. In fact, that also led to a few people walking out of the theatre but this is an ending that is contrary to popular, established writing patterns.

        Young director Karthik Varma Dandu has scored a huge hit with his recently released supernatural thriller, Virupaksha. Produced by BVSN Prasad and Sukumar, the film has turned out to be the biggest hit in hero Sai Tej’s career. Karthik Varma today met with the media to share his happiness over the film’s success
        “As Per Story written by me, Anchor Shyamala (who played Parvati Akka character) is the main culprit in the Film. But it was Sukumar sir who changed the screenplay and made Samyutha’s character the villain in the end” This revelation has surprised many with many wondering if the film would have achieved the same success had Shyamala been revealed as the antagonist instead of Samyuktha.
        While the film didn’t replicate the magic at a pan-India level, the Telugu version was more than enough to ensure all the involved parties bagged a hefty profit. Sukumar has lent a screenplay for this film that also stars Samyuktha, Rajiv Kanakala, and Sunil in key roles. The movie has been bankrolled by BVSN Prasad.
        The production design team effectively transports the viewers into the world of Rudravanam with commendable efforts.
The sound effects in Virupaksha are spine-chilling and contribute to the overall horror experience.
